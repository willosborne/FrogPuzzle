# Frog Puzzle
A puzzle game about frogs.

Something to take the edge off exams - I hope I finish it! 

It's built using the latest version of HaxeFlixel, so install that if you want to run it.

At the moment there aren't any builds or releases for it yet! 

You can edit maps for it using the Tiled map editor. Check out assets/data/map-1.edit.tmx 
NB *.edit.tmx is for editing, then exports to *.tmx, baking in tilemaps, templates and so on in the process.

I hope you enjoy it!
